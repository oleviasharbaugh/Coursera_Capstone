It has influences from France, Spain, and even local ethnic groups. It is an up and coming financial powerhouse with many new business oppourtunities developing every day. This port city has made a name for itself and is slowly transforming into what can only be called a global hub of business and commerce. \n    Though these are all great aspects of the city, they can also pose issues for those who are trying to enter into the restaurant market in Baton Rouge. Due to this difficulty, it is of utmost importance that all new businesses analyse the environment in which they are entering carefully. This analysis should help to mitigate risk and increase return in the long run.

Food tourism is a very large industry in this state. Keeping this is mind, it becomes clear that entering into this competitve market in Louisiana will not be easy, and further analysis should take place. \n\nFor example, one must consider:\n1. The population breakdown of Baton Rouge\n2. The presence of any Farmers Markets or anything of the like nearby to obtain ingredients \n3. The presence of population drawing\nvenues: Bars, Movie Theatres, Parks \n4. The presence and identity of competitors in that location as well as their cuisine \n5. The presence of any untapped or saturated markets\n\n    This analysis will use data on Baton Rouge and its many neighborhoods to determine the best location to open a brand new restaurant. This data includes the name of the neighborhood, the community in which it resides, the population of people in each neighborhood, and the latitude and longitude coordinates of the neighborhood. The use of Foursquare data will also help to determine other venues in Baton Rouge, details about them, and their location. The use of these two datasets should provide adequate information to determine the best place to open a new cajun restaurant.
